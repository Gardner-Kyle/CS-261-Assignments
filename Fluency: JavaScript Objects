// Object Creation Function:
function Car(make, model, year, mileage) {
  this.make = make;
  this.model = model;
  this.year = year;
  this.mileage = mileage;
  
  this.go() {do stuff..};
}
// This function is the prototype for the object Car.


// Inheritance & Properties & Methods & Instantiation:

// From this prototype objects can be created and they will inherit it's properties and functions. 
// This would be an instantiation of the Car prototype

var corolla = new Car("toyota", "corolla", "2005", "150000");
