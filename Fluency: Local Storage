// Local storage allows the user to store data in the web browser

// Set data:
localStorage.setItem("mytime", Date.now());
sessionStorage.mytime = Date.now();

// There is now a variable named mytime in the localStorage and sessionStorage and they contain the value of Date.now(). 
// SessionStorage can asscess its members using dot-notation.
// SessionStorage can only store the variable fr the current browser session, and it will then be removed automatically.


// Get data:
var time = localStorage.getItem("mytime", Date.now());
var timeS = sessionStorage.mytime;

// Local Storage keeps its values permanently, While sessionStorage does not.
// The variable time now contains the value of mytime that is stored in localStorage.
// The variable timeS contains the value of what was stored in sessionStorage in mytime.


// Remove data:
localStorage.removeItem("mytime");
sessionStorage.removeItem("mytime");

// The localStorage variable mytime is no longer stored in localStorage or sessionStorage.
// sessionStorage cannot remove items from storage with dot-notation.
