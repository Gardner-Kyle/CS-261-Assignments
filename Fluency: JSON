// When we get a JSON object from the API we are working with we need to 
// convert it to the object type that we want. To do this, we use JSON.parse()

// JSON that we receive from server:
'{ "name":"John", "age":30, "city":"New York"}'

// To parse:
var obj = JSON.parse('{ "name":"John", "age":30, "city":"New York"}');

// The JSON.parse() method looks through the string that we received 
// from the server for specific notifiers and then turns that string into and object.


// When we have an object that we want to send to our controller in the API, 
// we need to first turn it to JSON so that it can be received in JSON

// Object we want to turn to JSON:
var obj = { name: "John", age: 30, city: "New York" };

// To stringify:
var myJSON = JSON.stringify(obj);
